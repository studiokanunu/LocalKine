# Local'Kine Storage | Contact List

## Not the Best Practice

![Default Screen](./img/utcontact.png)

This is the perfect solution for, I dunno, cheating partners, spook types that don't want anything stored someplace someone could get at it, unless a person steals your phone **AND** cuts off your fingers so they can use touch identity to access whatever "contacts" you didn't want your husband, wife, boss, or the other spy to find.

***Aloha and a hui ho!***

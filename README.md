## Not the Best Practice

![Default Screen](./img/utcontact.png)

This was an exercise for a group hiring a bunch of remote React developer types.
I'm really *a hacker that steals like an artist*, so, I repurposed some shiznits I found on the web and submitted for the gig.

Started off by Googling-the-shit out of localstorage, and found many interesting articles, all of which basically emphasized that, just because you **can** use your browser's "data-base-like" functionality, it doesn't mean  you should. Anyway, found a project on GitHub from a couple of years back called Phone-Book-React Master; it didn't answer the mail. For example no localstorage capabilities which was a key requirement and meeting all provided "User Stories" was part of submission deliverables.

But back to the tale, the React syntax in my springboard code was attrocious too; complete disregard for camelBack or SCREAMING_SNAKE. And of course, it was missing some other functional requirements. But it was a good start despite the flaws, so I patched it up and ***ouila!***

This is the perfect solution for, I dunno, cheating partners, spook types that don't want anything stored someplace someone could get at it, unless a person steals your phone **AND** cuts off your fingers so they can use touch identity to access whatever "contacts" you didn't want your husband, wife, boss, or the other spy to find.

Oh yeah, I didn't get the gig, but truly don't feel bad about it; the exercise was a blast and the only critique I received concerned file naming convention and the lack of an npm run script. Other than that I can say "scroom,"  as of this date, these arseholes were looking for someone to fill a chari for more than seven months. Really sounds like crooked contracting to me. In any case, I would never join a crew that was that anally retentive.

***Aloha and a hui ho!***
